## 🎨 Marketing Materials Needed

### 1. Reddit Post Template

**Title:** I built a free app to help renters get their security deposits back

**Body:**
```
After losing $1200 on my last apartment (landlord claimed "damages" that were there when I moved in), I built something to fix this.

Introducing RentVault:
• Document everything on move-in day
• Timestamped photos with notes
• Generate PDF evidence report
• Works offline as PWA
• FREE forever

The sad truth: most renters lose deposits because they can't prove pre-existing damage. Photos get lost, timestamps are missing, no organized evidence.

How it helps:
1. Room-by-room photo checklist
2. Auto-timestamp + geotag
3. Add notes ("scratch on floor, here on move-in")
4. Export PDF for disputes

I made it free because landlords have lawyers, tenants have nothing.

### 2. TikTok Script (30 seconds)

```
[0-3s] "Lost your security deposit?"
[3-7s] "Landlords keep billions every year"
[7-15s] "I made a free app - RentVault"
[15-22s] "Document everything, export evidence"
[22-27s] "Get your deposit back"
[27-30s] "Link in bio, free forever"
```

### 3. Product Hunt Launch

**Tagline:** "Document your rental. Protect your deposit. Free forever."

**Description:**
```
44M+ US renters lose $16B in deposits annually because they can't prove property condition.

RentVault changes the game:
✅ Room-by-room documentation
✅ Timestamped evidence
✅ PDF report generation

✅ Free forever

Made by a renter, for renters. Because landlords have lawyers, we have documentation.
```
